description: |
  Before starting a large-scale redesign (10+ PRs that rewrite shared files like
  templates, base layouts, or central views), audit ALL unmerged feature branches
  for commits that touch the same files. Use when: (1) the user asks for a
  multi-PR redesign / restructure / migration, (2) the worktree is at the top
  of main but other long-running branches exist with active work, (3) the
  redesign will replace files wholesale (template rewrites, route extractions,
  base.css migrations), (4) the project has a multi-branch flow (one main per
  client/deployment, e.g. `main` + `release-uk` + `feature/whitelabel-X`).
  Symptom of having skipped this audit: hours after the redesign ships,
  cherry-picking the parallel branch's work into main produces a head-on
  conflict on the rewritten file (often progress.html / report.html / a base
  template), and the parallel branch's a11y / safety / hotfix commits are
  stranded — they must be hand-merged into the new markup rather than cleanly
  cherry-picked. Sister to `pre-merge-client-variant-regression-audit` (audits
  a variant branch BEING merged into main; this skill audits BEFORE main
  diverges from a variant). Different from `parallel-pr-scope-overlap-tiebreaker-delta-check`
  (which is about two PRs targeting the same scope simultaneously — this is
  about a redesign on main vs WIP on an unrelated long-running branch).

# Large-Redesign Parallel-Branch Collision Audit

## Problem

You're about to start a large multi-PR redesign that branches from `main`. The branch is clean, tests are green, the plan is locked. You execute 14 PRs overnight, all merge cleanly to main.

The next day someone asks: "What about the changes on `release-uk` / `feature/whitelabel-X` / `staging-customer-Y`?" — and you discover that long-running branch has 10 unmerged commits, including a11y/safety hotfixes on a file (`progress.html`, `report.html`, `_base.html`) that your redesign has just **completely rewritten** with the bold-editorial markup.

Now those 10 commits can't be cherry-picked cleanly. The a11y improvements you'd want to keep (innerHTML→DOM migration, button-onclick→href fixes, focus-trap fixes) collide directly with the redesigned markup. Hand-merge required, possibly losing safety improvements if not careful.

The root cause: **the redesigner audited main, not main + parallel branches.**

## Context / Trigger Conditions

Use this audit BEFORE starting work when **all** of these apply:

1. The user requests a multi-PR redesign / migration / restructure (anything that will rewrite ≥3 templates, the base layout, central views, or shared CSS)
2. The repo has a multi-branch flow — long-running parallel branches that aren't trivially behind main:
   - Client-variant branches (`release-uk`, `client-acme`)
   - Staging branches (`feature/whitelabel-X`)
   - Pending feature branches with unmerged work
3. The redesign will REPLACE files (not just restyle in-place)

If only restyling in-place (CSS class renames, no structural rewrite), the audit is less critical — `git merge` can usually combine the changes.

## Solution

### Pre-flight audit (run BEFORE the implementation plan is locked)

```bash
# 1. List all non-stale branches with commits ahead of main
for branch in $(git branch -r --no-merged origin/main 2>/dev/null | grep -v HEAD); do
  count=$(git log --oneline origin/main..$branch 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
  if [ "$count" -gt 0 ]; then
    last_activity=$(git log -1 --format="%ar" $branch)
    echo "$count commits ahead — $branch (last: $last_activity)"
  fi
done

# 2. For each non-stale branch (last activity < 30 days), check file collisions
#    with the files your redesign will touch
PLANNED_FILES="webapp/templates/progress.html webapp/templates/report.html webapp/templates/_base.html"
for branch in $(git branch -r --no-merged origin/main | grep -v HEAD); do
  hits=$(git log --oneline origin/main..$branch -- $PLANNED_FILES 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
  if [ "$hits" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "COLLISION RISK: $branch has $hits commits touching planned files:"
    git log --oneline origin/main..$branch -- $PLANNED_FILES
  fi
done
```

### Decisions to surface to the user BEFORE planning

For each collision-risk branch, ask:

1. **Promote first?** — Cherry-pick / merge the parallel branch's collision-risk commits into main BEFORE starting the redesign. The redesign then naturally absorbs them.
2. **Stake out scope?** — Carve the redesign to NOT touch the colliding files. (e.g. defer `progress.html` redesign until parallel branch lands.)
3. **Accept the cost?** — Proceed knowing that the parallel branch will need a careful hand-merge after the redesign. Document the planned conflict resolution upfront.

The user owns this decision. Don't decide unilaterally — surface it.

### Document the choice in the implementation plan

Add a section to the implementation plan: "Parallel-branch awareness." List each non-stale branch, file collisions if any, and the chosen disposition.

## Verification

After the redesign lands on main, run:

```bash
# Are there branches whose unmerged commits touch files we rewrote?
git log --oneline origin/main..origin/<parallel-branch> -- <files-we-rewrote>
```

If empty: clean — the parallel branch can be rebased onto main without manual file-level conflicts on the redesigned files.

If non-empty: the conflict resolution work was correctly anticipated and (per upfront planning) is queued for a follow-up PR.

## Example

**Scenario (S75 bold-editorial redesign, real)**:

Worktree on `worktree-redesigned-UI` branching from main `1ae1c4e`. Plan to redesign 13 templates including `progress.html`, `report.html`, `_base.html`, `home.html`, etc.

What was missed: `release-uk` branch had 10 commits ahead of main (last activity 1 week before S75 started), including:
- `f10b87c` per-test re-run buttons modifying validate.html / progress.html JS
- `bc913c0` progress.html a11y + innerHTML migration finish
- `125f178` progress.html innerHTML sinks → DOM construction
- `2410c37` decommission orphaned /permutation route

What happened: S75 PR #166 rewrote progress.html wholesale with bold-editorial markup. The a11y / innerHTML / DOM-construction improvements from #133 and #142 (still on release-uk) now conflict head-on. They can't be cherry-picked — they must be hand-merged into the new markup, preserving the safety improvements.

What the audit would have shown:

```
COLLISION RISK: origin/release-uk has 4 commits touching planned files:
f10b87c feat(report): per-test re-run buttons + /api/validation/rerun (#143)
bc913c0 fix(progress): a11y + finish innerHTML migration (#139 items 3-7) (#142)
125f178 fix(progress): migrate innerHTML sinks to DOM construction (#133) (#138)
2410c37 chore(routes): decommission orphaned /permutation route + dead helpers (#120) (#137)
```

The right move was to surface this in the kickoff `AskUserQuestion` and ask whether to:
(a) cherry-pick the 4 commits to main BEFORE starting the redesign
(b) defer progress.html / validate.html from the redesign scope
(c) accept the cost and plan a manual-merge follow-up PR

## Notes

- "Non-stale" is judgment — a branch with last activity 6 months ago and no open PR can usually be ignored. Branches with active commits in the last 30 days, or with an open PR, are the collision-risk set.
- The `--no-merged` filter excludes branches whose tips are already on main. Branches with squash-merged equivalents (different SHA, same content) will still show ahead — that's fine, the file-touch check is the actual filter.
- For monorepos with multiple deployable apps, run the file-touch audit per-app (different `PLANNED_FILES` set).
- This audit complements `pre-merge-client-variant-regression-audit` (which fires when bringing a variant branch INTO main, looking for regressions to the original client). Both should run on long-running multi-branch projects.
- If the user wants to proceed without the audit ("just go"), document the skipped audit in the plan's risk section so the post-merge surprise is at least anticipated.
